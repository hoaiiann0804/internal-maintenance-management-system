## About

Office Facility Maintenance Management System is an internal maintenance platform built for an office environment. It is designed for office assets such as printers, routers, air conditioners, meeting-room devices, and other shared equipment that need structured maintenance handling.

The system helps:

- staff report issues in one place and monitor resolution timelines
- managers assign work to primary and support technicians with better visibility
- technicians update progress in a controlled workflow with real-time SLA countdowns
- technicians dispatch equipment to external vendor partners when internal repair is not possible, with SLA paused automatically during the external service period
- administrators maintain users, departments, equipment, and vendor partner directories
- the organization track SLA compliance, vendor costs, and technician performance through built-in analytics and exportable reports

## Business Context

Before this system, maintenance requests were typically handled through scattered channels such as phone calls, email, chat tools, or direct messages. That approach makes it easy to miss requests, duplicate work, and lose operational history.

This project replaces that fragmented process with a centralized workflow so the team can:

- capture every request consistently with automated SLA targets based on priority
- track who created, assigned, supported, and resolved each ticket
- enforce mandatory resolution notes and cancellation reasons
- monitor SLA deadlines and trigger automated email alerts when tickets are near breach or overdue
- connect each maintenance request to a department and an equipment item
- dispatch equipment to external vendor partners with automatic SLA pause and repair cost tracking
- review ticket history and comments later for audit and reporting
- export comprehensive management reports covering technician performance, SLA compliance, and maintenance cost analysis

## Current Scope

The repository currently contains:

- an ASP.NET Core Web API backend
- a React + Vite frontend
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Staff, Technician)
- department, equipment, user, ticket, ticket attachment, vendor, and dashboard modules
- SLA calculation, real-time status badges, and background breach monitoring worker
- SMTP email alert service for SLA near-breach, breach, escalation, and ticket completion
- vendor dispatch workflow with SLA pause / resume and repair cost logging
- reporting & analytics module with technician performance, SLA compliance, and maintenance cost reports exportable to Excel
- pre-commit code formatting automation with Husky and lint-staged
- seeded demo data for local development

The frontend currently includes:

- `Login`
- `Dashboard`
- `Tickets`
- `Equipment`
- `Users`
- `Departments`
- `Vendors`
- `Reports & Analytics`

## Key Features

### Authentication

- JWT login
- current user profile lookup
- password change
- refresh token rotation
- logout via refresh-token revocation

### User Management

- admin-only user directory
- role-aware access
- department assignment
- active/inactive status control
- reset password support
- new Admin accounts are not created from the user-management form; existing Admin accounts can still be maintained

### Department Management

- create, update, read, delete departments
- unique department name protection
- dependency checks before deletion
- `IsMaintenanceTeam` flag to mark specialized maintenance departments

### Equipment Management

- create, update, read, delete equipment
- equipment assigned to a department
- immutable equipment code after creation
- support for office asset tracking

### Maintenance Tickets

- create maintenance requests with priority-based SLA deadlines
- view ticket queue and detail
- assign primary technician and optional support technician
- change ticket status through workflow rules
- cancel tickets with mandatory cancellation reason modal
- add comments and discussion threads
- track status history and audit log
- store resolution notes, cancellation reasons, and resolution timestamps

### SLA Management & Automated Escalation

- automated target resolution duration based on priority:
  - **Critical**: 2 hours
  - **High**: 8 hours
  - **Medium**: 24 hours (1 day)
  - **Low**: 48 hours (2 days)
- real-time SLA countdown timers and color-coded status badges on client UI (`InSLA`, `NearBreach`, `Breached`, `MetSLA`, `MissedSLA`, `Paused`, `Cancelled`)
- background `SlaMonitorWorker` running periodically to evaluate open tickets against SLA deadlines
- automated near-breach warnings (< 1 hour remaining) and breach detection
- automated escalation alerts when overdue duration exceeds threshold

### Email Notifications & Alerts

- SMTP integration using MailKit / MimeKit (`SmtpEmailService`)
- near-breach warning emails sent to assigned technicians
- SLA breach alerts sent to department managers
- escalation emails sent to system administrators for severely overdue tickets
- SLA outcome notification emails sent upon ticket completion (`MetSLA` / `MissedSLA`)

### Ticket Attachments & Storage

- presigned file upload flow (Cloudflare R2 / S3 / Local storage compatible)
- list attachments per ticket
- preview modal for images, videos, and PDF documents
- secure download link generation
- attachment deletion with role/owner permissions

### Vendor Management

- create and manage external vendor partner records (name, contact person, phone, email, address)
- active/inactive status toggle per vendor
- vendor directory accessible by Admin and Manager roles
- vendors selectable when dispatching equipment for external repair

### Vendor Dispatch & SLA Pause

- technicians can transition a ticket to `WaitingForVendor` status to dispatch equipment to an external partner
- when dispatched, the ticket SLA timer is automatically **paused** (`SlaStatus = Paused`) so the waiting period does not count against the internal team's SLA
- the dispatch log records the selected vendor, estimated return date, technician notes, and actual repair cost (`RepairCost`)
- when the equipment is returned, the technician resumes work (`InProgress`), and the SLA timer continues from the paused point
- repair cost data feeds directly into the maintenance cost analytics and Excel reports

### Dashboard & Analytics

- real-time KPI overview (tickets by status, active vs maintenance equipment, technician and department metrics)
- interactive status and priority distribution charts
- department equipment breakdown
- role-scoped data filtering

### Reporting & Analytics (Admin / Manager)

Three analytical pillars accessible from the `/reports` page:

**Technician Performance**
- total assigned, in-progress, waiting-for-vendor, resolved counts per technician
- SLA compliance rate and missed SLA count per technician
- average resolution time (MTTR) in hours
- bar chart comparison of SLA compliance rates across the team

**SLA Compliance**
- overall compliance rate across all tickets
- breakdown by priority (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- monthly SLA compliance trend line chart (last 6 months)
- counts for active tickets: InSLA, NearBreach, Breached, Paused

**Maintenance Cost**
- total vendor repair spend, total vendor dispatches, and average cost per dispatch
- monthly cost trend bar chart (last 6 months)
- cost breakdown by department (pie chart)
- top 5 costliest equipment items (replacement candidates)

**Export**
- **Excel (.xlsx)**: one-click export generating a single workbook with all three report sheets
- **PDF**: browser print dialog for on-screen printing or PDF generation
- **Filters**: date range (with future-date validation), department, and technician filters

### Theme & UI Polish

- Light and Dark mode toggle with system preference support
- responsive tables, modal dialogs, SLA badges, and status indicators

### Code Quality & Git Hooks

- Husky pre-commit hook integration
- lint-staged automated formatting with Prettier and lint checking with ESLint prior to code commits

## Access Model

The backend uses role-based access control:

- `Admin`
- `Manager`
- `Staff`
- `Technician`

Ticket visibility is filtered by role:

- `Admin` can access all tickets
- `Manager` can access tickets in their department
- `Staff` can access tickets they created
- `Technician` can access tickets assigned to them (as primary or support technician) or created by them

Report access is restricted to `Admin` and `Manager` roles only. Managers see data scoped to their department; Admins see the full organization view.

## Ticket Workflow Rules

- A ticket can be cancelled from `Pending` or `Assigned` (requires a `cancellationReason`)
- SLA deadline (`dueAt`) is automatically determined based on priority at creation
- A ticket can move from `InProgress` to `WaitingForVendor`; SLA is **paused** automatically
- A ticket can move from `WaitingForVendor` back to `InProgress`; SLA **resumes**
- A ticket can move from `InProgress` to `Resolved` (requires a `resolutionNote`)
- Moving to `Resolved` or `Closed` checks completion against `dueAt` to record `MetSLA` or `MissedSLA`
- Closed tickets should not be modified
- Every status change is stored in history

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js LTS + pnpm
- Docker Desktop

### Start the Database

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

### Start the API

```powershell
dotnet run --project InternalMaintenance.Api
```

API: `http://localhost:5253` | Swagger: `http://localhost:5253/swagger`

### Start the Frontend

```powershell
cd InternalMaintenance.Client
pnpm install

- [x] One-click Excel export (3 sheets in one workbook)
- [x] PDF print export via browser
- [x] Date range, department, and technician filters with future-date validation

### Phase 4 — Asset Lifecycle & Preventive Maintenance (Planned)

- [ ] **Equipment QR Code**: Generate printable QR code labels per equipment item; enable camera-scan lookup on mobile web
- [ ] **Preventive Maintenance Scheduling**: Define recurring inspection schedules per equipment; automatically generate tickets before the due date
- [ ] **Maintenance History Timeline**: Equipment-level view of all past tickets, repairs, and costs
- [ ] **Warranty Tracking**: Store warranty expiry per equipment and surface warnings when creating tickets

### Phase 5 — Collaboration & Real-Time Features (Planned)

- [ ] **Push / In-App Notifications**: Real-time alerts inside the app when a ticket is assigned, commented on, or SLA is breached (SignalR)
- [ ] **@Mention in Comments**: Tag a colleague in a comment to trigger a notification
- [ ] **Technician Workload View**: Visual board showing current open ticket load per technician
- [ ] **Mobile-Responsive PWA**: Progressive Web App support for field technicians

### Phase 6 — Location & Physical Hierarchy (Planned)

- [ ] **Location Hierarchy**: Building -> Floor -> Room model so equipment can be pinned to a physical location
- [ ] **Location-Based Ticket Routing**: Suggest the nearest available technician based on room location

### Longer-Term Ideas

- [ ] **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Data isolation for multiple organizations within a single platform instance
- [ ] **Subscription & Billing Model**: Usage tier management and invoicing
- [ ] **Predictive Maintenance & Forecasting**: Analyze repair history to forecast equipment failure rates
